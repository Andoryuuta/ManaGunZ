base address in ldscript must have same 16 bytes alignment that stage2_addr (from ps2emu_stage1)

Examples:
0x2BB8A20 -> 0x0BADCAFE00000000
0x2BB8A24 -> 0x0BADCAFE00000004
0x2BB8A28 -> 0x0BADCAFE00000008
0x2BB8A2C -> 0x0BADCAFE0000000C


TODO :
For now every firmware have the same alignement... but it might be better to use 
4 ldscript, and to add in makefile, ' if firmware=XXX then $LDSCRIPT=ldscript_X '
